Server-Client Communication ASI
=============

What is this?
-------
an .ASI mod I worked on for about 3-4 days over a year ago, I couldn't find any other developers interested in helping me, so I lost interest and burried the source. don't know why is it not posted. There is a more promising alternative available here: https://github.com/BJIADOKC/samp-addon


old video demonstrating the mod: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R5JWkXeFvQ

Future Development
-------
Right now I am not working on this, there are no future plans to fix this, or even look through it, I don't know what kind of information is in these files cause I havne't looked at them in over a year, I'm not sure what works and what doesn't the source files are provided as is only.
